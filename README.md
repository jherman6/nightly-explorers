## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in what you need:

| Variable | Required? | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Yes | Used for SEO canonical URLs, sitemap, Stripe redirect URLs. Set to `https://nightlyexplorers.com` in production. |
| `LEADS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Recommended | Where waitlist + contact submissions are sent. See below. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Optional | Enables real Stripe Checkout on the waitlist form. |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` | Optional | The Price ID of your subscription product. |
| `STRIPE_TRIAL_DAYS` | Optional | Defaults to `7`. |

**Without `LEADS_WEBHOOK_URL` or Stripe configured, the site still works** —
submissions are simply logged in the Vercel function logs, and the waitlist
form just collects name + email without charging anyone. This means you can
deploy today and wire up the rest later.

### Wiring up real lead capture

`LEADS_WEBHOOK_URL` can point at:
- A **Zapier** "Catch Hook" trigger → fan out to Google Sheets, Mailchimp, Slack, etc.
- A **Make.com** webhook
- A **Supabase** Edge Function that inserts into a database table
- Any custom endpoint of your own

The payload sent is a JSON object like:
```json
{ "type": "waitlist", "firstName": "Jamie", "email": "jamie@example.com", "source": "final-cta", "submittedAt": "2026-06-18T00:00:00.000Z" }
```

If you'd rather use a dedicated email tool's native embed (ConvertKit,
Mailchimp, Klaviyo, etc.) instead of this custom form, that's a reasonable
alternative — just replace the `<WaitlistForm />` usage in
`src/components/sections/FinalCTA.tsx` with their embed snippet.

### Turning on Stripe Checkout

1. In the Stripe Dashboard, create a **Product** with a recurring **Price**
   (this is what your subscription will charge).
2. Copy that Price ID (looks like `price_1Q...`) into `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`.
3. Copy your **Secret key** (Developers → API keys) into `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
4. Redeploy. The waitlist form will now create a Stripe Checkout session
   (subscription mode, with a free trial) instead of just collecting a lead.
5. Set up a webhook in Stripe pointed at your own endpoint if you want to
   react to subscription events (this starter doesn't include a Stripe
   webhook handler — add one at `src/app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts` if/when
   you need to sync subscription status into your own database).

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. In Vercel, **Add New Project** → import the repo.
3. Add the environment variables from `.env.example` under
   **Settings → Environment Variables**.
4. Deploy.
5. Under **Settings → Domains**, add `nightlyexplorers.com` and follow
   Vercel's DNS instructions (usually an `A` record to `76.76.21.21` or a
   `CNAME` to `cname.vercel-dns.com`, depending on whether you're using the
   root domain or a subdomain).

## Before you launch, also do this

- [ ] Have a lawyer review `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/ai-policy`, and `/cookies`
      — they're solid starting templates, not a substitute for legal review.
- [ ] Add real social links in `src/lib/constants.ts` (`SITE.twitter`, etc.)
- [ ] Add a real analytics tool (Vercel Analytics, Plausible, or GA4)
- [ ] Replace the placeholder OG image copy in `opengraph-image.tsx` if your
      messaging changes
- [ ] Run `npm run build` locally once before your first deploy to catch any
      environment-specific issues early
